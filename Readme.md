# A monorepo, short for "monolithic repository", is an approach to software development in which everything

# A project's source code is stored in a single version control repository, such as Git. Instead of splitting the code

# in multiple repositories (separate repositories for different parts of the project), a monorepo contains all components, modules and libraries

# related to the project in one place.

#

# commands to run the project, lint and format

# npx turbo run dev

# npx turbo run lint

# npx turbo run format

# to run lint in a specific repository that we have in the monorepo, we directly enter the repository and execute the respective command
